# Personal Website

This project was created as a university assignment, but I also took the opportunity to turn it into a personal website.

## Overview
A simple multi-page website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The site includes a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the result dynamically affects the UI theme.

## Features
- 3-page layout with a navigation bar
- Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- Dynamic theme changes based on game result (win / lose / draw)
- Clean separation of structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JavaScript)

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to practice core frontend concepts such as layout design, DOM manipulation, and basic state handling without using any frameworks.

## Usage as a Template
You are free to use this project as a template for your own personal website or for learning purposes.  
Feel free to modify, extend, or adapt it to your needs.
